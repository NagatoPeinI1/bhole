Jai Om Numah Shivaya

<br>
Jai Om Numah Shivaya
<br>
<br>
Well everybody would you focus your mind
Search for the truth and you will find
Good spirit and strength from within
That fights against all sin
<br>
<br>
Jai Om Numah Shivaya

<br>
<br>
I shall walk across the land that has been chosen
and I shall climb the mountain so high,
I shall go across the sea and across the ocean
and sing with the bird in the sky,
Its only Jah up above man who leads the way
under whose shadow I abide,
Me say you're running and you're running and you're running away
but from yourself you know you can¹t hide
<br>
<br>
Jai Om Numah Shivaya
<br>
<br>
Well everybody would rise and focus your mind
Search for the truth and learn to be kind
Everybody would you fight against the evil you find
Tell you people about the 'Religion of your Mind¹
<br>
<br>
Jai Om Numah Shivaya
<br>
<br>

He who dwells in the secret place of the most high
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I
Everyday I Rise...Rise up above their lies
But still them want fight I and I
Everyday I Rise ...Rise with my spirits well high
Ca you know Jah Jah guide I and I
<br>
<br>
Jai Om Numah Shivaya
